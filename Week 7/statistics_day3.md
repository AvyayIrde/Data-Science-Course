Graphs of Frequency Distributions

Frequency Histogram
â€¢ A bar graph that represents the frequency distribution.
â€¢ The horizontal scale is quantitative and measures the data
values.
â€¢ The vertical scale measures the frequencies of the classes.
â€¢ Consecutive bars must touch.
â€¢ Bars are centered at class midpoints
â€¢ Bars are graphed between class boundaries.


How to Sketch a Frequency Histogram
Steps-
1. Locate and label class midpoints (or boundaries) along the x axis.
2. Make tick marks at the midpoint between each pair of consecutive midpoints. These
are the location of your class boundaries where you histogram bars will connect.
3. Sketch a bar for each class. The height of each bar should be equal to the frequency
of the class. Histogram bars should be centered around class midpoints.
4. Label your x and y axis. The y axis should be labeled â€™frequencyâ€™ and the x axis
should be labeled as the variable you measured in the data.

Frequency Polygon
â€¢ A line graph that emphasizes the continuous change
in frequencies.

How to Sketch a Frequency Polygon
Steps-
1. Locate and label class midpoints along the x axis.
2. Above each midpoint draw a point whose height above the x-axis is equal to the
frequency of that class.
3. Locate the left-hand x-intercept. Subtract the class width from the lowest class
midpoint, and locate the resulting number on the x-axis
4. Locate the right-hand x-intercept. Add the class width to the largest class midpoint,
and locate the resulting number on the x-axis
5. Connect your points with line segments. The final graph should make a closed figure
with the x-axis.
6. Label your x and y axis. The y axis should be labeled â€™frequencyâ€™ and the x-axis
should be labeled as the variable you measured in the data.

Relative Frequency Histogram
â€¢ Has the same shape and the same horizontal scale as the
corresponding frequency histogram.
â€¢ The vertical scale measures the relative frequencies
(percentages), not frequencies.


How to Sketch a Relative Frequency Histogram
Steps-
1. Locate and label class midpoints (or boundaries) along the x axis.
2. Make tick marks at the midpoint between each pair of consecutive midpoints. These
are the location of your class boundaries where you histogram bars will connect.
3. Sketch a bar for each class. The height of each bar should be equal to the relative fre-
quency (either decimals or percents) of the class. Histogram bars should be centered
around class midpoints.
4. Label your x and y axis. The y axis should be labeled â€™relative frequencyâ€™ and the x
axis should be labeled as the variable you measured in the data.

Cumulative Frequency Graph or Ogive
â€¢ A line graph that displays the cumulative frequency of
each class at its upper class boundary.
â€¢ The upper boundaries are marked on the horizontal axis.
â€¢ The cumulative frequencies are marked on the vertical axis.


How to Construct an Ogive
Steps-
1. Construct a frequency distribution table that includes cumulative frequencies as one of
the columns. Find and write down values for the boundaries of your classes.
2. Locate upper class boundary numbers along the x-axis. Locate and draw an ordered
pair for each class in your frequency distribution table. Each ordered pair will have the
coordinates
(x,y) = (upper class boundary,cumulative frequency)
â€¢ The horizontal scale consists of the upper class boundaries.
â€¢ The vertical scale measures cumulative frequencies.
3. Plot points that represent the upper class boundaries and their corresponding cumulative
frequencies.
4. Connect the points in order from left to right.
5. The graph should start at the lower boundary of the first class (cumulative frequency is
zero) and should end at the upper boundary of the last class (cumulative frequency is
equal to the sample size).


Graphs:
1. Frequency Distribution â€” graph is a histogram or frequency polygon( y axis will be frequency , x axis will be class limits )
2. Relative Frequency Distribution â€” graph is a histogram( y axis will be relative frequency, x axis will be class midpoints )
3. Cumulative Frequency Distribution â€” graph is an ogive ( y axis will be cumulative frequency , x axis will be class midpoints DO NOT CONNECT DOTS FROM STARTING/ ENDING CLASS LIMITS  )

The different types of parameters and statistics:
1. Measures of central tendency are numbers that represent the typical value in a data set. Measures of central tendency measures the location of the center of the data.
A) Mean B) Median C) Mode  - most common measures of CT

Mean(average):The sum of all the data points divided by the number of data points

Median: The value that lies in the middle of the data when the data set is ordered
Ex- 872,432,597,427,399,786,397 -> Transform to sorted nature --> 397,399,427,432,597,786,872 (odd number of data points- median is the middle data entry , in our ex median is 432)
Ex2-397,399,427,432,597,786(even number of data points- median is the mean of the two middle data points , in our ex2 Median is 427+432//2=430)

Mode:The data point that occurs with the greatest frequency 
Ex- 1,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9 Mode is 3 
Ex2- 1,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,9,9 Mode will be 3 and 9 (bimodal)

Mean of a frequency distribution table: (refer to diagram)

Skewness- A distribution of data is skewed if it is not symmetric and extends more to one side than to the other.
1. Symmteric distribution 2. Negative skew 3. Positive skew (refer to diagram)

2. Measures of spread are numbers that measure how spread out a data set is along the x-axis.
A)Range of a data set is the difference between the max and min data points in the set (Max entry- Min entry)
Ex-41 38 39 45 47 Range--> 47-38 --> 9 

Deviation value for a particular number in a data set is the distance betwen the data entry and the mean of the data set. 
B) Standard deviation C) Variance ( refer to diagram example ) D) IQR 

Interpreting SD- When interpreting SD , remember that it is the measure of the typical amount a data point/entry deviates from the MEAN. 
The more the entries are spread out, the greater the standard deviation. 

The Empiral Rule - For a data set with symmetric distribution, the SD has the following characteristics:
1. About 68% of the data lie within one standard deviations of the mean.
2. About 95% of the data lie within two standard deviations of the mean.
3. About 99.7% of the data lie within three standard deviations of the mean.

3 Measures of location/position are numbers that measure the location of data value relative of the center of the data(Z-scores) and relative of the other data points(fractiles)

Fractiles are numbers that partition an ordered data set into equal parts

Quartiles:
Q1 reps first quartile: about one quater of the data fall on or below Q1 
Q2 reps second quartile: about one half of the data fall on or below Q2(median)
Q3 reps third quatile: about three quaters of the data fall on or below Q3

Ex- 7 18 11 6 59 17 18 54 104 20 31 8 10 15 19  

---> 6 7 8 10 11 15 17 18 18 19 20 31 54 59 104 

# steps

1. find median from the entire data set - 18 
2. Split the quartiles on the median q1=(6,7,8,10,11,15,17) q2=(18) q3=(18,19,20,31,54,59,104)
3. find median from q1 and q3 -> q1 median is 10 q3 median is 31 
4. IQR=q3-q1= 31-10=21 

Interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile . 
IQR= Q3-Q1 --> 31-10=21

Inference- The number of data points in the middle portion of the data set vary by at most 21

Box-and-whisker plot
 Exploratory data analysis tool.
 Highlights important features of a data set.
 Requires (five-number summary): Minimum entry, First quartile Q1, Median Q2,
Third quartile Q3, Maximum entry

* Idea here is to show the 5 number summary of a data set 

How to draw a Box-and-Whisker Plot ( FYI )
# Guidlines 

1. Find the five-number summary of the data set.
2. Construct a horizontal scale that spans the range of the data.
3. Plot the five numbers above the horizontal scale.
4. Draw a box above the horizontal scale from Q1 to Q3 and draw a vertical line in the
box at Q2.
5. Draw whiskers from the box to the minimum and maximum entries.

Using the Interquartile Range to Identify Outliers:

1. Find Q1 and Q3
2. Find the interquartile range, IQR = Q3-Q1
3. Multiply the IQR by 1.5
4. Subtract (1.5)*(IQR) from Q1 to find the lower fence.
lowerfence = Q1-(1.5 *(IQR))
Any data entry less than the lower fence is an outlier.
5. Add Q3 to 1.5*IQR  to find the upper fence.
upperfence = Q3 + (1.5 * (IQR))
Any data entry greater than the upper fence is an outlier.


6 7 8 10 11 15 17 18 18 19 20 31 54 59 104
Example from above:

1. Q1 = 10 and Q3 = 31
2. Find the interquartile range, IQR = Q3-Q1 = 21
3. Multiply the IQR by 1.5:- 1.5*21 = 31.5
4. lower fence = 10-31.5 i.e Q1-(1.5 *(IQR)) = -21.5 There is no data entry less than -21.5 value.
5. upper fence = 31 + 31.5 i.e  Q3 + (1.5 * (IQR))= 62.5 So, 104 is an outlier since it is greater than 62.5.

Standard Score (z-score):

 Every number x in a data set has a z-score
 A z-score represents the number of standard deviations a given value x is away from the
mean Mu
 z-score formula z = (x-Mu) /(S.D/squareroot(n))
 Always round z-scores to the hundredths.
 A z-score can be negative, positive or zero.
 When z is negative the corresponding x value is less than the mean
 When z is positive the corresponding x value is greater than the mean
 When z = 0 the corresponding x value is equal to the mean
