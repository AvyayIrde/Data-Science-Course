How to Design a Statistical Study

1. Identify the variable(s) of interest (the focus) and the population of the study.
2. Develop a detailed plan for collecting data. If you use a sample, make sure the sample
is representative of the population.
3. Collect the data.
4. Describe the data using descriptive statistics techniques.
5. Interpret the data and make decisions about the population using inferential statistics.
6. Identify any possible errors.

Types of Statistical Studies

1.Observational Study
2.Experiment

A statistical study can be categorized as observational study or an experiment.

Observational study A researcher observes and mea-
sures characteristics of interest of part of a population,
but does not change existing conditions.

Experiment In performing an experiment, a treatment is
applied to part of a population, called a treatment group,
and responses are observed. Another part of the popula-
tion may be used as a control group, in which no treat-
ment is applied.(The subjects in the treatment and control groups are called experimental
units.) In many cases, subjects in the control group are given a placebo, which is a harmless,
fake treatment, that is made to look like the real treatment. The responses of the treatment
group and control group can then be compared and studied to help determine if the treatment
was effective, or if the treatment causes side effects. In most cases, it is a good idea to use
the same number of subjects for each group.

Try These! Decide whether the study is an observational study or an experiment.

1. Researchers demonstrated in people at risk for cardiovascular disease that 2000 milligrams
per day of acetyl-L-carnitine over a 24-week period lowered blood pressure and improved in-
sulin resistance - Experiment 

2. Researchers conduct a study to determine where a drug used to treat hypothyroidism
works better when taken in the morning or when taken at bedtime. To perform the study,
90 patients are given one pill to take in the morning and one pill to take in the evening (one
containing the drug and the other a placebo). After 3 months, patients are instructed to
switch pills - Experimental study 

3. Researchers conduct a study to determine the number of falls women had during preg-
nancy. To perform the study, researchers contacted 3997 women who had recently given
birth and asked them how many times they fell during their pregnancies - Observational study 

4. A researcher stood at each busy intersection to see if the color of an automobile that a person
drives is related to running red lights - Observational study 

5. A researcher finds that people who are more hostile have higher total cholesterol levels than
those who are less hostile - Observational study 

6.Subjects are randomly assigned to four groups. Each group is placed on one of four special
diets-a low-fat diet, a high-fish diet, a combination of low-fat diet and high-fish diet, and a
regular diet. After 6 months, the blood pressures of the groups are compared to see if diet has any
affect on blood pressure - Experimental study

2.Experiment

3.Survey:-

a)Sample
b)Census

4.Simulation

There are several ways to collect data.
Often the focus of the study dictates
the best way to collect data.

The four ways we collect data are:

1. by conducting an observational study
2. by conducting an experimental study
3. by conducting a simulation
4. by conducting a survey

• Simulation uses a mathematical or
physical model to reproduce the con-
ditions of a situation or process, often
by use of computers. Simulations al-
low you to study situations that are
impractical or too dangerous to cre-
ate in real life, and they often save
time and money. For instance, Auto-
mobile manufacturers use simulations
with dummies to study the effects of
crashes on humans.

• A Survey is an investigation of one or more characteristics of a population. The most
common types of surveys are done by interview, Internet, phone, or mail. An official
count or survey of a population is called a Census.


Consider the following statistical studies. Which method of data collection would
you use to collect data for each study?

1. A study of the effect of changing flight patterns on the number of airplane accidents - Simulation 
2. A study of the effect of eating carrots on lowering blood pressure - Experiment 
3. A study of how sixth grade students solve a puzzle - Survey / observational study 
4. A study of U.S. residents’ approval rating of the U.S. president - Survey 
5. A study of the weights of all linemen in the NFL - Survey 
6. A study of the effects of aspirin on preventing heart attacks - Experiment 


Experimental Design

To produce meaningful unbiased results, experiments
should be carefully designed and executed. It is im-
portant to know what steps should be taken to make
the results of an experiment valid. Three key ele-
ments of a well-designed experiment are con-
trol, randomization, and replication. Because
experimental results can be ruined by a variety of fac-
tors, being able to control these influential factors is
important. One such factor is a confounding variable.
A confounding variable occurs when an experi-
menter cannot tell the difference between the effects
of different factors on the variable.

For instance, to attract more customers, a coffee shop owner experiments by remodeling her
shop using bright colors. At the same time, a shopping mall nearby has its grand opening.
If business at the coffee shop increases, it cannot be determined whether it is because of the
new colors or the new shopping mall. The effects of the colors and the shopping mall have
been confounded. Another factor that can affect experimental results is the placebo effect.
The placebo effect occurs when a subject reacts favorably to a placebo when in fact the
subject has been given a fake treatment. To help control or minimize the placebo effect, a
technique called blinding can be used.

Blinding is a technique where the subjects do not know whether they are receiving a
treatment or a placebo. In a double-blind experiment, neither the experimenter nor the
subjects know if the subjects are receiving a treatment or a placebo. The experimenter is
informed after all the data have been collected. This type of experimental design is preferred
by researchers.

Another element of a well-designed experiment is randomization. Randomization is a pro-
cess of randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups. In a completely random-
ized design, subjects are assigned to different treatment groups through random selection.

In some experiments, it may be necessary for the experimenter to use blocks, which are
groups of subjects with similar characteristics. A commonly used experimental design is a
randomized block design. To use a randomized block design, the experimenter divides
the subjects with similar characteristics into blocks, and then, within each block, randomly
assign subjects to treatment groups. For instance, an experimenter who is testing the effects
of a new weight loss drink may first divide the subjects into age categories such as 3039
years old, 40 49 years old, and over 50 years old, and then, within each age group, randomly
assign subjects to either the treatment group or the control group

Another type of experimental design is a matched-pairs design, where subjects are paired
up according to a similarity. One subject in each pair is randomly selected to receive one
treatment while the other subject receives a different treatment. For instance, two subjects
may be paired up because of their age, geographical location, or a particular physical char-
acteristic. Sample size, which is the number of subjects in a study, is another important
part of experimental design. To improve the validity of experimental results, replication is
required.

Replication is the repetition of an experiment under the same or similar conditions.

Sampling Techniques

In a Random Sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of
being selected.

The five sampling techniques presented here are: Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Sam-
pling, Cluster Sampling, Systematic Sampling and Convenience Sampling.

In NonRandom sampling, technique used is convenience sampling 


Simple Random Sample

Every possible sample of the same size has
the same chance of being selected. One
way to collect a simple random sample is
to assign a number to each member of the
population. Random numbers can then be
generated by a random number table, a
software program or a calculator. Mem-
bers of the population that correspond to
these numbers become members of the sam-
ple.

Example There are 37 students in Mr.
Busken’s Friday stats class. You wish to
form a sample of five students to answer
some survey questions. Select the students
who will belong to the simple random sam-
ple. Use the calculator’s ”randInt” func-
tion.

Stratified Sample

Divide a population into groups (strata) so
that subjects within the same subgroup
share the same characteristics (such as gender or age bracket) and select a random sample
from each group.

Example To collect a stratified sample of Mr. Busken’s students, you could divide the
students up into age groups, then randomly select a couple people from each age group.

Cluster Sample

Divide the population into groups (clusters) and select all of the members in one or more,
but not all, of the clusters.

Example To collect a cluster sample of Mr. Busken’s students, you could divide the stu-
dents up into age groups, then select all the students in one or more age brackets.

Systematic Sample

Choose a starting value at random. Then choose every kth member of the population.

Example To collect a systematic sample of Mr. Busken’s students, you could number the
students 1 through 37, randomly choose a starting number, then select every 4th person.

Convenience Sample

Choose only members of the population that are easy to get Often leads to biased studies
(not recommended).

Identify the sampling technique used.

1. Using random digit dialing, researchers ask 300 U.S. adults if they care about the next
election - Simple Random Sampling 

2. A student asks 12 friends in her dorm to participate in a psychology experiment - convenience sample 

3. A study of water quality in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil randomly selects and collects water
samples from 33 of the 55 communities from the Rio metropolitan area - cluster sample 

4. Law enforcement officials at the Kaaboo concert stop and check the driver of every third
vehicle for their blood alcohol content. -Systematic sample 

5. Twenty-six students are randomly selected from each grade level at a high school and
surveyed about their study habits. -Stratified sample 

6. A journalist interviews 150 people waiting at an airport baggage claim and asks them
how satisfied they are with the airline they flew - Simple random sampling 

7.Nursing supervisors are selected using random number in order to determine annual salaries - Simple random sampling 

8. Mail carriers of a large city are divided into four groups according to gender (male or female)
and according to whether they walk or ride on their routes. Then 10 are selected from each group
and interviewed to determine whether they have been bitten by a dog last year - Stratified sample

2.1 Frequency Distributions and Their Graphs

Learning objectives:

1. Learn the terminology that goes along with a Frequency Distribution Table.
2. Construct a Frequency Distribution, Construct a Relative Frequency Distribution, Construct a Cumu-
lative Frequency Distribution
3. Construct Frequency Histograms, Frequency Polygons, Relative Frequency Histograms, and Ogives

Defn: A Frequency Distribution is a two-column table that summarizes a list of measure-
ments or responses. Column 1 of the frequency distribution table is a list of classes. These
classes can be single numbers, intervals of numbers or categories. Column 2 of the frequency
distribution is the frequency column. The numbers in this column represent the number of
measurements or responses that were measurements or responses from their corresponding
numeric classes or category classes.

EXAMPLE 1: Suppose that in a previous semester, a random sample of my students were
asked what their age was. The frequency distribution below summarizes the list of the ages
that make up the sample. The first column of the table is a list of age intervals, or age cla-
Classes 

Frequencies, f
(Age Intervals) (counts)
15—24 68
25—34 72
35—44 34
45—54 16
55—64 8
65—74 2
sses. 
The frequency number in row 2 of the table is
68. This means there were 68 students in the sam-
ple between and including ages 15 and 24. From the
next row of the frequency distribution, we see that
there were 72 students who said they were between
and including ages 25 and 34. There were 34 students
between and including ages 35 and 44, 16 students
between and including ages 45 and 54, 8 students be-
tween and including ages 55 and 64, and 2 students between and including ages 65 and 74.

EXAMPLE 2: 10 randomly selected history students were asked how many absences they
had in their history class last semester. The 10 responses are summarized in the table.

Classes Frequencies, f
(absences) (days absent)
0 1
1 3
2 4
3 0
4 1
5 1
You can tell 1 student had zero absences, 3 students
had one absence, 4 students had two absences, and so
on. Example 2 gives us an example of a frequency dis-
tribution where the classes are single numbers. Exam-
ple 1 gives us an example of a frequency distribution
whose classes are number intervals. It is also possi-
ble to make a categorical frequency distribution
with qualitative data. The next table gives us and
example of a categorical frequency distribution.

EXAMPLE 3: 100 randomly selected students were asked their blood type.

Classes Frequencies, f
(blood type)
A 40
B 11
AB 4
O 45

EXAMPLE 4: Earthquake magnitudes for the month of July were randomly selected. The
data is summarized in the frequency distribution.

Classes Frequencies, f
(magnitudes) (Number of Earthquakes)
0.0—0.9 5
1.0—1.9 15
2.0—2.9 17
3.0—3.9 13
4.0—4.9 45
5.0—5.9 35
6.0—6.9 10
7.0—7.9 5

EXAMPLE 5: Gasoline prices of regular unleaded from 30 gas stations were randomly
selected. The data is summarized in the frequency distribution.

Classes Frequencies, f
($ intervals) (Number of Gas Stations)
$3.00—$3.49 15
$3.50—$3.99 8
$4.00—$4.49 5
$4.50—$5.00 2

Guideline for Collecting Quantitative Data :

—All your measurements must be numbers measured to the same precision.

Examples: In Example 1, the student ages data was a set of whole number ages. In Example
4, the earthquake data set was a list of magnitudes that were decimal numbers in the tenths,
such as 7.1, 3.4, 5.6, and so on. In Example 5, the gas prices data set was a list of dollar
amounts, rounded to the nearest hundredth, such as $3.09, $3.29, $3.15, etc.

VOCABULARY EXERCISES : Use the Age Frequency Distribution from Ex-
ample 1 to answer the following questions.

Classes frequencies, f
(Age Intervals) (counts)
15—24 68
25—34 72
35—44 34
45—54 16
55—64 8
65—74 2

1) How many classes does the table have? Ans - 6 
2) What numbers represent lower class limits? Ans- 15-24 
3) What numbers represent upper class limits? Ans - 65-74 
4) What is the class width? max-min//number of classes --> Ans--> 74-15//6 -> 9 
5) What is class midpoint? Ans- 74+15//2 --> 44 ( upperlimit+lowerlimit//2)

Guideline for Class Limit Numbers:(FYI) 

—Class limit numbers must be numbers measured to the same precision as the numbers in
the data set.

Examples: In Example 1, the class limits were whole numbers, so the student ages data
was a list of whole number ages. In Example 2, the class limits are whole numbers, so the
data (number of absences) was a list of whole numbers. In Example 4, the class limits were
decimal numbers measured to the tenths decimal place value column, so the earthquake data
set was a list of magnitudes that were decimal numbers measured in the tenths (such as 7.1,
3.4, 5.6, and so on). In Example 5, the class limits were dollars rounded to the nearest cent,
so the gas prices data set was a list of dollar amounts, rounded to the nearest hundredth
(such as $3.09, $3.29, $3.15, etc). (In Example 3 there were no class limit numbers, since
the data was qualitative data, not quantitative data)

Guideline for Class Boundary Numbers: (FYI) 

1) Class Boundary numbers are the midpoints of the gaps that separate classes
2) Class Boundary numbers are decimal numbers that are measured out to one decimal
place value column more than the numbers in the data set, and they end in a 5.

An Important Property of Class Width : (FYI)
—Consecutive class midpoints are separated by a distance equal to the class width.
—Consecutive lower class limits are separated by a distance equal to the class width.
—Consecutive upper class limits are separated by a distance equal to the class width.
—Consecutive lower boundaries are separated by a distance equal to the class width.
—Consecutive upper boundaries are separated by a distance equal to the class width.

Steps - How to Construct a Frequency Distribution Table (using interval classes)

1. Enter the data into the calculator and sort it in ascending fashion.
2. Decide on the number of classes (usually between 5 and 20).
3. Find the class width with this formula

class width = max − min/number of classes

Always round the class width number up. For example, if the formula give class
width as 24.1 round that up to 25.

4. Write down column 1 of your table, the class limit numbers. Write down lower class
limit numbers first. Then write down upper class limit numbers.

A First write down (use) the minimum value in the data list as the lower class limit
of the 1st interval class. Use your sorted data to find the minimum of the data
list.

B Add class width to the minimum to find (and write down)the lower class limit
number for the 2nd interval class. Add class width to the lower class limit of the
2nd class to find the lower class limit of the 3rd interval class. Keep on adding
class width to find the next lower class limit, until you find and write down all
lower class limit numbers.

C Write down upper class limit numbers.

5. Use your sorted data to write down the numbers in the frequency column (the 2nd
column) of your frequency distribution table.

6. Double check your work.

Example

The following sample data set lists the prices (in dollars) of 30 portable global positioning
system (GPS) navigators. Construct a frequency distribution that has seven classes.

90 130 400 200 350 70 325 250 150 250
275 270 150 130 59 200 160 450 300 130
220 100 200 400 200 250 95 180 170 150

The sorted data
59 70 90 95 100 130 130 130 150 150
150 160 170 180 200 200 200 200 220 250
250 250 270 275 300 325 350 400 400 450 

Example

Now make an Expanded Frequency Distribution (table) that includes midpoints, relative
frequencies, cumulative frequencies and percentage cumulative frequencies.

classes| freq., f |midpoint, Xm | relative frequency |cumulative frequency | % cumulative freq.
59 — 114 5
115 — 170 8
171 — 226 6
227 — 282 5
283 — 338 2
339 — 394 1
395 — 450 3

The Midpoint of a class is found using the formula

class midpoint = upper class limit + lower class limit/2

The Relative Frequency of a class is the portion or percentage of the data that falls in
a particular class.

relative frequency = class frequency/sample size = f/n

The Cumulative frequency of a class The sum of the frequency for that class and all
previous classes.
